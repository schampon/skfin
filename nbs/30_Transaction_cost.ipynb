    "The goal of this section is to take transaction costs into account when evaluating a strategy. More precisely, discussing the cost of executing a trade requires an introduction to market microstructure. Beyond explicit costs, there are implicit trading costs that can significantly impact the pnl of a strategy. Intuititvely, the price will move against a party who wants to execute a significant trade -- ie. the price will increase (resp. decrease) as a party wants to buy (resp. sell) a significant amount of security. Crucially, this can happen even if no trading happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this section, the impact of transaction is evaluated along two directions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- evaluate whether the strategy pnl covers costs; \n",
    "\n",
    "- improve the strategy so that the transaction costs are lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "The latter point generally highlights a tradeoff between alpha (trading quickly to avoid alpha decay) and costs (avoid costs from execessing trading). "
